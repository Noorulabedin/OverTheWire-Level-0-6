##### OverTheWire Bandit Level 0 - 6 #####
----- Walkthrough For Beginners -----

How to connect to the OverTheWire server
# Everytime you complete the level you need to connect the server each time.
The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.

# Command: ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

ssh to connect with the server
-p to define the port that is 2220

# Output: This is a OverTheWire game server. More information on http://www.overthewire.org/wargames

bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password: bandit0

## Check whether you're in the right directory or not
# Command: pwd
# Output: /home/bandit0



----- Bandit Level 0 → Level 1 -----
## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

## Commands you may need to solve this level
ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

# Command: ls
# Output: readme

Let's understand! cat command allows us to create single or multiple files, view content of a file, concatenate files and redirect output in terminal or files.
# Command: cat readme
# Output: boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1



----- Bandit Level 1 → Level 2 -----
## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory

## Commands you may need to solve this level
ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

# Command: exit
# Ouput: logout
Connection to bandit.labs.overthewire.org closed.

## Connect again to bandit1 server
# Command: ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
# Output: This is a OverTheWire game server. More information on http://www.overthewire.org/wargames

bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password: boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1
Note: You need to press Right Click and paste do not press CTRL+V in linux terminal and press Enter.

# Command: pwd
# Output: /home/bandit1

# Output: UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK



----- Bandit Level 3 → Level 4 -----
## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

## Commands you may need to solve this level
ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

## Exit and connect to bandit3 server as we did recently.

# Command: ls -apls
# Ouput: total 24

4 -rw-r--r--  1 root root  675 May 15  2017 .profile

# Command: cd inhere
cd "Change directory" because the inhere is not a file it's a directory so we need to get into inhere directory by cd inhere.
# Output: bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$

# Command: ls -apls
# Ouput: total 12
4 drwxr-xr-x 2 root    root    4096 May  7  2020 ./

----- Bandit Level 4 → Level 5 -----
## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

## Commands you may need to solve this level
ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

## Exit and connect to bandit4 server as we did recently.

# Command: pwd
# Output: /home/bandit4

# Command: ls -apls
# Output: total 24
4 drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 May  7  2020 ./
4 drwxr-xr-x 41 root root 4096 May  7  2020 ../
4 -rw-r--r--  1 root root  220 May 15  2017 .bash_logout
4 -rw-r--r--  1 root root 3526 May 15  2017 .bashrc
4 drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 May  7  2020 inhere/
4 -rw-r--r--  1 root root  675 May 15  2017 .profile

# Command: cd inhere
# Output: bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$

# Command: ls
We used ls to just to see the main files you can use ls -apls as well it's your choice.

# Ouput:
-file00  -file02  -file04  -file06  -file08
-file01  -file03  -file05  -file07  -file09

Now we need to find the human-readable file
# Command: find . -type f | xargs file

We used find to find -type of file type and xargs file to human-readable it's the linux basics part so you don't need to worry about it.
# Output:
./-file01: data
./-file00: data
./-file06: data
./-file03: data
./-file05: data
./-file08: data
./-file04: data
./-file07: ASCII text
./-file02: data
./-file09: data

# Command: cat ./-file07
# Ouput: koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh



----- Bandit Level 5 → Level 6 -----
## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable

## Commands you may need to solve this level
ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

## Exit and connect to bandit5 server as we did recently.

# Command: pwd
# Output: /home/bandit5

# Command: ls -apls
We used ls to just to see the main files you can use ls -apls as well it's your choice. But ls -apls is recommended to check all the files.
# Output: total 24
4 drwxr-xr-x  3 root root    4096 May  7  2020 ./
4 drwxr-xr-x 41 root root    4096 May  7  2020 ../
4 -rw-r--r--  1 root root     220 May 15  2017 .bash_logout
4 -rw-r--r--  1 root root    3526 May 15  2017 .bashrc
4 drwxr-x--- 22 root bandit5 4096 May  7  2020 inhere/
4 -rw-r--r--  1 root root     675 May 15  2017 .profile

# Command: cd inhere
# Output: bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$

# Command: ls
# Ouput:
maybehere00  maybehere04  maybehere08  maybehere12  maybehere16
maybehere01  maybehere05  maybehere09  maybehere13  maybehere17
maybehere02  maybehere06  maybehere10  maybehere14  maybehere18
maybehere03  maybehere07  maybehere11  maybehere15  maybehere19

Challenge: We have to find the file according to given details we can't check each file right? we will waste our time.

# Command: find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable
- f for file
- -type to find
- size to specify file size
- ! -executable to specify the file which is non executable

# Output: ./maybehere07/.file2

# Command: cat ./maybehere07/.file2
# Ouput: DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7



----- Bandit Level 6 → Level 7 -----

owned by user bandit7
owned by group bandit6

## Commands you may need to solve this level
ls, cd, cat, file, du, find, grep

## Exit and connect to bandit6 server as we did recently.

# Command: find . -type -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c
-user for specify the user
-group to specify group

# Output: Tons of files ---> You need to find the password file
File Needed: /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

Go each directory at a time to learn no need to copy the whole path.
